           <h3>What  is rabies?</h3>

<p>Rabies is a contagious and fatal disease that is passed from animal to human through bite. It is mostly transmitted from dogs and bats and mostly occurs at low income countries. Rabies is also caused by the rabies virus. </p>

        <h3>When was it discovered?</h3>

<p>Rabies was first dscovered in Italy by a physician named Girolamo Fracastoro in the 16th century. The cure was finally found in 1885 by a French biologist called Louis Pasteur. </p>
