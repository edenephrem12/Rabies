	<h1>Meet Our Team!</h1>
	<p> Our team include Eden Ephrem, Christian Lopez, and Cindy Kwok</p>
	<h2>Christian Lopez</h2>
	<p>Hello, I am a SMASH Scholar at the Stanford Site and here is some information about me. I like chocolate, water, and sleeping on my bed. I also know a few things about this and that meaning my knowledge can be random at times. As a person, I am an aloof guy in a way and can talk to someone as some sort of therapist or just a talking buddy. Some careers I am interested in are Robotic Engineer, Bio-Engineer, or Astrology/Astrophysicist.</p>

	<h2>Cindy Kwok</h2>
	<p> Hey everyone, my name is Cindy Kwok and I am a SMASH scholar at Stanford. My hobby includes playing with my dog. I am very passionate about dogs. Therefore, when choosing a disease, our group chose rabies. Rabies are the most common in dogs due to the fact that many dogs in low-income countries are not properly vaccinated. Which leads to many cases and high rates of death due to rabies. The focus of this project is to help low-income communities decrease their death rates with rabies. </p>

	<h2>Eden Ephrem</h2>

	<p> My name is Eden Ephrem and I am a 1st year scholar at SMASH. Something to know about me is that I love helping people as much as I can. My favorite colors are purple, black, and blue. I have 4 dogs but I love all kinds of animals. Which is why I chose rabies as my disease project. My hobbies include swimming but I also do that as a sport along with waterpolo. In the future I don't know what I want to do but i know it has something to do with helping people.
