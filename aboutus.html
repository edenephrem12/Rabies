	<p>Hello, I am a SMASH Scholar at the Stanford Site and here is some information about me. I like chocolate, water, and sleeping on my bed. I also know a few things about this and that meaning my knowledge can be random at times. As a person, I am an aloof guy in a way and can talk to someone as some sort of therapist or just a talking buddy. Some careers I am interested in are Robotic Engineer, Bio-Engineer, or Astrology/Astrophysicist.</p>
