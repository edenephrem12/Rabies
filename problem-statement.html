<h1>Problems With Rabies</h1><br>
<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<p>Low-Income communities are the most likely to have higher death rates or be heavily affected by rabies. Rabies may not seem like an epidemic or much of a threat here in America but in other lower-income communities or countries may have a problem with dealing with this in terms of treating a person after they have gotten the disease to preventing or lessing the number of incidents with rabies.</p>

<p>This graph shows the death rate in different areas. As shown in the graph, the central area has the most death rates by rabies than the other areas by 2015. If the rabies problem in those areas aren't fixed, soon enough it will grow to a point large numbers. There can also be many areas where it really isn't a problem and that is because they may have better resources than the other places or areas around them.</p><br>

<p>This graph shows the situations of where the stray dogs go. Many stray dogs get impounded and, depending on the area, it will take a long time before the owner or someone comes in and picks them up. Otherwise they will most likely get euthanased because the holding place can no longer continue to house them. Other times they are either claimed or euthanased but they may or may not be carrying rabies.</p><br>
<img class="graphs" src="images/location.rabies.jpg" width="350" height="250">
<p>This one shows where rabies is located or where it could be. As it can be seen, rabies is just about everywhere and there are very few places where its status is unknown or it is absent. Though it is still present in many areas that are most likely populated with people and that also means that they can have pets or work with animals. If one of those animals got infected and bit a person, they would have an easier time getting a cure if they were in a high income community. Otherwise they would have a harder time getting cured or treated if they were in a lower income community and that will usually lead to death.</p><br>
