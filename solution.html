<h1>Solution to Rabies</h1>

<p>The solution for the disease rabies is a mobile clinic that is connected to a system of phone booths with first aid kits. The purpose of this is to boost the availability of tests and treatment for rabies.</p>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
	<li>If a person spots a dog or is bitten by a dog, they would then use the phone booth to call for help.</li>
    <li> Then they would proceed with the dog capturing device or use the first aid kit to disinfect the wound.</li>
    <li> The mobile clinic would then go to their location and examine the person that has been bitten as well as examine the dog. </li>
    <li>After the dog will be brought to the shelter where it can be vaccinated.</li>
</ol>

<h2>More Information on our Mobile Car</h2>

<p>So, for our mobile clinic, there is going to be three sections in our mobile clinic. The first section is the exam room. The exam room can be a place where the wound is examined by the doctor and check the wound. The second section, the vaccination room, would be where the doctor would prescribe the patient to post-exposure prohylaxis. The third section is the patient room where the patient can recover from their injuries and wound.</p>

<h2>How Does Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis Work?</h2>

<p>Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis is a vaccine used after a person is bitten by an animal or another infected person. This vaccines help boost the immune system along with helper T cells to prevent the virus from spreading. The vaccine is simply a weakened version of the rabies virus. This is safe, because your immune system fights it off.</p>
